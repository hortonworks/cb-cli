NAME:
   Cloudbreak command line tool

USAGE:
   Cloudbreak command line tool configure [command options] [arguments...]

DESCRIPTION:
   it will save the provided server address and credential to ~/.cb/config

REQUIRED OPTIONS:
   --server value    server address [$CB_SERVER_ADDRESS]
   --username value  user name (e-mail address) [$CB_USER_NAME]

OPTIONS:
   --password value  password [$CB_PASSWORD]
   --profile value   selects a config profile to use [$CB_PROFILE]
   --output value    supported formats: json, yaml, table (default: "json") [$CB_OUT_FORMAT]```

### Configure
Although there is an option to provide some global flags to every command to which Cloudbreak to connect to, it is recommended to save the configuration.
A configuration entry contains the Cloudbreak server's address, the username and optionally the password and the output format.
Multiple configuration profiles can be saved by specifying the `--profile` switch. The same switch can be used as a global flag to the other commands to use a specific profile.
If the profile switch is omitted, the `default` profile is saved and used.
```
cb configure --server https://ec2-52-29-224-64...compute.amazonaws.com --username your@email --password your-password --profile cloudbreak-staging
```
This will save the configuration into the user's home directory. To see its content: `cat ~/.cb/config`. If this config file is present you don't need to specify the connection flags anymore,
otherwise you need to specify these flags to every command.
```
cb cluster list --server https://ec2-52-29-224-64...compute.amazonaws.com --username your@email --password your-password
```

### Create cluster
To create a cluster with the CLI, a cluster descriptor file needs to be put together and specified as an input to the `cluster create` command:
```
cb cluster create --cli-input-json create_cluster.json
```

The cluster descriptor is basically the JSON request that's being sent to the Cloudbreak API.
The full reference of this descriptor file can be found in the API docs.
The CLI can help with creating the skeleton of the cluster descriptor JSON.
The following command outputs a descriptor file with empty values:
```
cb cluster generate-template aws existing-subnet --blueprint-name "my-custom-blueprint"
```
The `aws` and `existing-subnet` keywords are subcommands to the `cluster generate-template` command and help with creating a skeleton with proper entries for the selected cloud provider and network configuration.
Use the `-h` option to see the available subcommands, e.g.:
```
cb cluster generate-template -h
```
Direct the output to a file to save the skeleton locally.
```
cb cluster generate-template aws existing-subnet > create_cluster.json
```
To create a cluster, fill the empty values or change the existing ones and use the `create-cluster` command above.

### Terminate cluster
To terminate the previously created cluster use the `delete-cluster` command.
```
cb cluster delete --cluster-name my-cluster
```

### Describe cluster
If you want to check out the properties of a running cluster the `describe-cluster` command can be useful.
```
cb cluster describe --cluster-name my-cluster
```

## Bash/Zsh autocompletion
To enable autocompletion on bash or zsh source the appropriate file under the `autocomplete` folder:
```
source autocomplete/bash_autocomplete
```
On linux copy the file into `/etc/bash_completion.d/cb`. Don't forget to source the file to make it active in the current shell.

## Debug
To enable the debug logging use the `--debug` global switch
```
cb --debug cluster list
```
or provide it as an environment variable `export DEBUG=1` or inline
```
DEBUG=1 cb clusters list
```

## Proxy settings
To use the cb cli behind a proxy you must use the following environment variable:
```
 export HTTP_PROXY=10.0.0.133:3128
```
or with basic auth:
```
export HTTP_PROXY=http://user:pass@10.0.0.133:3128/
```

## Dependency management

This project uses [Dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) for dependency management. You can install it and download the configured dependency versions with:
```
go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep (or brew install dep)
dep ensure
```
